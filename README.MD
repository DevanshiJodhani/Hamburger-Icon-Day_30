## Description

A "hamburger icon" refers to a specific type of icon used in user interfaces, typically consisting of three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other. It resembles the appearance of a hamburger sandwich, with the top bun, meat patty, and bottom bun represented by the three lines. The hamburger icon is often used to represent a menu or navigation option in software applications, websites, and mobile apps.
